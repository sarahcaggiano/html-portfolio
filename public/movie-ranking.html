<h1>The Best Movies According to Sarah</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirit</h3>
<p>
    I've loved this movie ever since I was young. It is what encouraged my love
    of horses.
</p>
<h3>Knives Out</h3>
<p>
    I think this movie is perfect. It is funny and clever with ingenious twists
    and everything that happens is intentional with ripples throughout the plot.
</p>
<h3>Arrival</h3>
<p>Really cool alien movie with interesting analysis of linguistics.</p>
